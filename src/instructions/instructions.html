<H3>How to play Big2</H3>
			<P>The game is played by four players. (A variation of this game called Magic Big 2 can be played by three players).</P>
			<P>The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt 13 cards. Each player take turn to play the cards on the table
			according to the game rule. If a hand cannot be play, the player will have to pass. If three consecutive passes
			are made, the first player can start a new set.</P>

			<P>The first player to finish all the cards is the winner and the remaining cards held by the other players are
			counted. For gamblers, usually the winner is paid according the cards left. For social entertainments, the counts
			are just tallied.</P>
			<H3>Rules</H3>
			<H4>Starting the game</H4>
			<P>The player who has the three of diamond will play first. The three diamond can be played as a single card or
			in combination with others forming a pair, three, four or five card sets.</P>
			<H4>Card ranking</H4>
			<P><IMG SRC="3diamond.gif" WIDTH="53" HEIGHT="69" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"> is the smallest card and <IMG SRC="2spade.gif"
			WIDTH="53" HEIGHT="69" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"> is the highest card.</P>

			<P>The suites are rank in the order of Diamond, Club, Heart and Spade. So a typical hand may be sorted like this
			from left to right:</P>

			<P>
			<H4>Card Sets</H4>
			<P>Single card/P>
			<P>Each player place a card onto the table that is ranked higher that the last one played. If the two of spade
			is played, the player can immediate start a new set as it is the largest card.</P>
			<P><BR>

			Pair</P>
			<P><IMG SRC="pair.gif" WIDTH="73" HEIGHT="69" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" HSPACE="6">A pair is two card of the same
			kind. If the next player has also the same kind, they can be played if one of the suite is ranked higher. For the
			example on the left, if the next player has a pair of consisted of 7 club and 7 diamond, that pair can be played.</P>
			<P><BR>
			Three of a kind</P>
			<P><IMG SRC="three.gif" WIDTH="93" HEIGHT="69" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">Also called triplet. Played similar to pairs.</P>
			<P><BR>
			<BR>

			<BR>
			Four of a kind</P>
			<P><IMG SRC="four.gif" WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="69" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">Four of a kind can be played but it is very
			rare if anyone would want to play it since it is better off to add an extra card to make it five so as to empty
			the hand faster.</P>
			<P>
			<H4>Five cards sets</H4>
			<P>When it comes to the five card sets, the poker sequence will apply. The only twists is that the Royal flush
			is ranked lower that the Straight flush which has the 2 card in it. Hence the ranking for five card sets from low
			to high are:</P>

			<P><BR>
			Straight</P>

			<P><IMG SRC="straight.gif" WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="69" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">Also called snake by Cantonese. Straight
			is a sequence of five cards not in the same suite.</P>

			<P><BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			Flush</P>

			<P><IMG SRC="flush.gif" WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="69" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">Also called flower by Cantonese. Flush
			is five cards of the same suite.</P>

			<P><BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			Full house</P>

			<P><IMG SRC="fullhouse.gif" WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="69" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">Full is a pair and a triplet. The triplet
			is compared first followed by the pair. Therefore a 333-22 is smaller than AAA-44.</P>

			<P><BR>

			<BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			Four of a kind</P>

			<P><IMG SRC="fourplus1.gif" WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="69" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">As mentioned above, four of a kind
			is best played as a five card poker hand.</P>

			<P><BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			Straight flush</P>

			<P><IMG SRC="straightflush.gif" WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="69" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">Straight flush is a sequence of
			the same suite. Ace, two, three, four and five is ranked the highest.</P>

			<P><BR>
			</P>

			<H3>Other variations to the game</H3>
			<P>Rotation - some people prefer to place a pen/pencil on the table while playing. The tip of the pen/pencil will
			mark the direction of the turns. Clockwise followed by anti-clockwise.</P>
			<P><A NAME="PickBig2"></A>Pick Big 2 or Magic Big 2 - This modified version is when there are only three players.
			After the cards are dealt for each player, the remaining 13 are place in the middle of the table. If a player cannot
			play a hand (or wishes not to), he/she will take a card from that pile and added into the hand. Hence the name
			<I>&quot;pick&quot;</I> or <I>&quot;magic&quot;</I> as it can change the &quot;fortune&quot; of the player's hand.</P>
